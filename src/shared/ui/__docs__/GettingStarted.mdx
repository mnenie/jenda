**Jenda UI Kit** is a custom, reusable component library designed to help developers create user interfaces faster with a cohesive design language. Created as part of the Jenda project, this UI kit provides pre-built, customizable Vue components tailored for seamless integration and intuitive use.

### **Usage**

Import components you want into your UI

`import { UiButton, UiBadge, UiInput } from '@shared/ui';`

and use them like so

```
<script setup lang="ts">
import { UiButton } from '@/shared/ui';
</script>

<template>
   <UiButton variant="outline" size="lg">hello from ui</UiButton>
</template>
```

### **Run and develop UI Kit locally**

Clone the [Jenda repository](https://github.com/mnenie/jenda) then start Storybook.

`yarn && yarn run storybook`

### **Theme Support**

Jenda UI Kit components support multiple themes: light, dark, and system (auto-switches based on userâ€™s OS preferences). This allows for a more personalized and accessible UI experience across devices and environments.
